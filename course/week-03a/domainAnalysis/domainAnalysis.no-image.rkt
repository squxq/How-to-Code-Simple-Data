;PROBLEM:
;
;Use the How to Design Worlds recipe to design an interactive
;program in which a cat starts at the left edge of the display 
;and then walks across the screen to the right. When the cat
;reaches the right edge it should just keep going right off 
;the screen.
;
;Once your design is complete revise it to add a new feature,
;which is that pressing the space key should cause the cat to
;go back to the left edge of the screen. When you do this, go
;all the way back to your domain analysis and incorporate the
;new feature.
;
;To help you get started, here is a picture of a cat (open the image file), which we
;have taken from the 2nd edition of the How to Design Programs 
;book on which this course is based.
