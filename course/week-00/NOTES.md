# 0: Introduction

## Welcome

What makes it hard to write programs? When you’re asked to write a program you’re typically given a poorly formed problem. The question is:

> What do we want our problem to do?
> 

The second thing that makes programming hard is that oftentimes the program is too big for us to solve in one go. The question is:

> How do we break down a problem?
> 

That whole trip from poorly-formed problem to well-structured solution that’s systematic design. The course uses a specially designed programming language called Beginner Student Language, BSL.
